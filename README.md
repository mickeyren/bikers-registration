# Setup

## 1. Clone the repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

`git clone git@github.com:mickeyren/bikers-registration.git`

## 2. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

`yarn` 

## 3. Start the development server:

Run:

`yarn dev`

This will run a server so you can access the UI in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

Open your browser and point it to http://localhost:3000.


## Production build:

Run:

`yarn build`

This will optimize and minimize the compiled assets.
